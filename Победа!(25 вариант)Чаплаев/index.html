        <h3>Man and Nature</h3>
        <p>Poets, artists and writers have praised the beauty of the surrounding world at all times. Hundreds of thousands of poems and songs are dedicated to nature. It is difficult to find prose where there would be no description of the landscape. In painting, images of nature and animals are separated into separate genres, and many artists have chosen these directions for themselves… Emotionally, a person admires nature, but practically treats it in a consumerist, if not barbaric way, which is reflected in the canvases and poems of such artists and poets as A.M. Kurilovich, who captured oil rigs, or S.Ya. Marshak, who described the very essence of consumer relations.</p>

        <h3> Geographer V.A. Anuchin</h3>
        <p>
According to the geographer V.A. Anuchin, who has been dealing with the problems of interaction between man and nature for many years, there are three basic laws of the geosphere that a person simply cannot ignore:
The law of interdependence of the development of individual elements of the geosphere.
The law of increasing human impact on the natural environment.
The law of increasing human dependence on the natural environment.
The more we influence nature, the more actively it responds to us. And in most cases, the answer turns out to be very far from favorable: the environmental situation is deteriorating, natural disasters are increasingly occurring. The fate of the further development of mankind depends on how quickly ways will be found to resolve the contradictions between the limited capabilities of our biosphere and the aggressive type of development of society in relation to it. </p>

        <h3>The human impact on the environment </h3>
        <p> The anthropogenic factor is becoming the leading one, and without taking it into account it is impossible to understand and assess what else will happen to our common home. The level of human influence on the environment is also determined by how the changed nature affects the further development of our society.</p>

        <h3>About the role of nature in human life…</h3>
        <p>At different times and in different cultures, the concept of the role and significance of the surrounding world for a person differed significantly. In the period of antiquity, nature was considered as a mobile, constantly changing whole, while natural, organized and perfect. Man in ancient philosophy was not opposed to nature, but rather was one of its parts. Living in harmony with nature was considered an ideal.
However, medieval Western Christian culture acquired a completely different understanding of nature. Man in Christianity is the pinnacle of divine creation, endowed with a soul, and the whole surrounding world stands immeasurably below him. Nature was often understood even as a source of evil that needed to be subdued</p>

        <h3>Man considers himself the king of nature</h3>
        <p>He naively thinks that everything is allowed to him. Probably for this reason, we do not appreciate all that we have. To understand what we are talking about now, just look around you. You will see mountains of abandoned garbage, lying packages, cigarette butts, plastic bottles. And all this on the shore of a beautiful pond, where it would be so nice to relax. But it was not there. Resting among the garbage is not very pleasant. It seems that the people who have been here are completely devoid of common sense and do not think about tomorrow at all. They live by the principle - after me, though the grass does not grow. There are no rules for them. They don't know what a trash can is. But no one has canceled the boomerang law. As you treat nature, so it will treat you.</p>

        <h3>In the Renaissance, the attitude to nature</h3>
        <p>However, medieval Western Christian culture acquired a completely different understanding of nature. Man in Christianity is the pinnacle of divine creation, endowed with a soul, and the whole surrounding world stands immeasurably below him. Nature was often understood even as a source of evil that needed to be subdued.
In the Renaissance, the attitude towards nature is changing again. A person discovers its beauty, sees it as a source of joy and pleasure. It is not for nothing that so many magnificent works of art appear during this period of time, praising the beauty of the surrounding world.
Moreover, if we face the truth, then one way or another a consumerist and arrogant attitude towards nature prevailed. Man imagined himself to be the crown of creation, which allowed him to consider nature only as an object of his activity, remaking and reshaping it in accordance with his needs.</p>
